## Author
Terry Migwi

## Project Description
This project is courtesy of a football dataset by Mchezopesa Limited. As the data scientist of Mchezopesa, I am required to: 

       1. make prediction of team scores using polynomial regression
       
       2. figure out the team's perspective if the game is a win, draw or a loss using logistic regression
       
 ## Installation Requirements
1. Clone the repo by running: git clone https://github.com/Terry-Migwi/Datascience_Core_Week_6_IP.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd pandas

3. Open the Vs code: code
