# Polynomial Regression and Logistic Regression
This repository contains a notebook on Logistic and Polynomial Regressions with Exploratory Data Analysis 

## Title
Supervised Learning with Exploratory Data Analysis

## Author
Terry Migwi

## Project Description
This project is courtesy of a football dataset by Mchezopesa Limited. The study required merging of two datasets and performing Analysis on the data to determine the statistical properties and the distribution of the variables. Feature Engineering has been performed to obtain a variable that will be used in Modeling. Two Regression Models have then been fit on the data as follows:

       1. make prediction of team scores using polynomial regression
       
       2. figure out the team's perspective if the game is a win, draw or a loss using logistic regression
       
 ## Installation Requirements
1. Clone the repo by running: git clone https://github.com/Terry-Migwi/Regression-Models.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd pandas

3. Open the Vs code: code
